# Celebrity Image Classification
This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to classify images of celebrities. It utilizes computer vision techniques for image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify specific personalities from input images.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an automated system capable of recognizing faces and classifying them into specific categories (celebrities). The workflow includes loading images, preprocessing them using OpenCV, training a classifier using Scikit-Learn, and saving the model for deployment.

## Tools Used
Python
OpenCV (cv2) (Image processing and loading)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
NumPy & Pandas (Data manipulation)
Scikit-Learn (Model training, evaluation, and GridSearch)
Joblib (Model serialization)

## Dataset
The model is trained to recognize specific celebrities. Based on the code, the classes include:

Elon Musk
Lionel Messi
Oprah Winfrey
Warren Buffett
